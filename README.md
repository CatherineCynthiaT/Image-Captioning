# Image-Captioning-using-BLIP-and-Gradio
This project involves creating an image captioning application using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model, which has been trained on the COCO datasetâ€”a large-scale dataset known for its extensive collection of images and corresponding captions. The application is designed to generate descriptive captions for any uploaded image, providing users with a quick and accurate description of the content within the image. The model is integrated into a user-friendly web interface using Gradio, allowing users to easily upload images and receive captions in real-time. The entire setup is implemented in Python, making use of the Hugging Face `transformers` library for the model and Gradio for the deployment, ensuring the application is both accessible and efficient.
